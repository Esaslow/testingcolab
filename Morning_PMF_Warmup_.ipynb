        "\n",
        "You are going to build a class that represents discrete probability distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create a module called `my_stats`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Write a generic `PMF` class, that represents a probability mass function. It will need to store:\n",
        "  * values\n",
        "  * associated probabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Initialize each PMF with a dictionary representing a mapping from value => probability. If the PMF is initialized without an argument use a reasonable default value.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. You should allow querying of your PMF by value and return a probability. Write a `prob()` method that takes an input value as an argument, and returns the probability of getting that value.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Also allow for the case of updating a value after a PMF object has already been created. Create a `set()` method on your class that takes a key => value pair to update.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. The last thing your PMF class should do is print its distribution. Create a method `print_pmf()` that outputs the distribution as a list of tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note: The PMF should always be normalized, i.e. the sum of the probabilities should be 1.**\n",

        "\n",
